### Features
- **Automated Environment Setup**: Quickly configure your development environment for smart contract management.
- **Compile and Deploy**: Automatically compile and deploy smart contracts to the Stellar network.
- **Contract Monitoring**: Easily monitor smart contract performance and state.
- **Efficient Management**: Manage contract updates and configurations with minimal effort.
- **Data Analysis and Backup**: Analyze contract data and ensure reliable backups.
- **CI/CD Integration**: Seamlessly integrate with CI/CD pipelines for continuous deployment and testing.

## Installation

To get started with AutoSoroban, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/AutoSoroban.git
    cd AutoSoroban
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
    Ensure you have Ansible installed. You can install it using pip:
    ```bash
    brew install ansible
    ```

3. **Configure Your Environment**:
    Ensure you have the necessary Stellar network credentials and configurations.

## Usage

AutoSoroban is organized into several key stages, each defined by a YAML file. Here's how you can use each stage:

1. **Development Environment Setup**:
    ```bash
    ansible-playbook 01_development_environment_setup.yaml
    ```
    Sets up your development environment for smart contract automation.

2. **Compile and Deploy Contract**:
    ```bash
    ansible-playbook 02_compile_and_test_deploy_contract.yaml
    ```
    Automates the compilation and deployment of your smart contracts.

3. **Monitoring Contract**:
    ```bash
    ansible-playbook 03_monitoring_contract.yaml
    ```
    Monitors the performance and state of your deployed contracts.

4. **Managing Contract Update**:
    ```bash
    ansible-playbook 04_managing_contract_update.yaml
    ```
    Facilitates easy updates and management of your smart contracts.

5. **Analyzing and Backup Contract**:
    ```bash
    ansible-playbook 05_analyzing_backup_contract.yaml
    ```
    Analyzes contract data and creates backups for reliability.

6. **CI/CD Integration**:
    ```bash
    ansible-playbook 06_ci_cd_integration.yaml
    ```
    Integrates your contract lifecycle with CI/CD pipelines for continuous deployment and testing.

## Configuration

To customize AutoSoroban for your specific needs:

- **Edit YAML Files**: Each YAML file can be modified to suit your environment and contract requirements. Look for variables at the top of each file and adjust as needed.
- **Add New Stages**: You can add new Ansible playbooks to extend the functionality of AutoSoroban.
- **Environment Variables**: Use environment variables to manage sensitive data like Stellar network credentials.
